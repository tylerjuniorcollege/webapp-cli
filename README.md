# WebApp
A Commandline Application that helps facilitate Creating, Modifying, and Releasing A Simple Web Application

## Introduction
### What is this?
This is a set of tools to help with creating, modifying, and releasing a simple Web Application, using Slim Framework (or with configuration, your favorite framework). This project attempts to mimic some aspects of the ZF1 Tool, where a developer could create a base application structure with a simple command.

Additionally, WebApp will work with bower and composer, along with [Assetic](https://github.com/kriswallsmith/assetic), to build release code for production environments.
